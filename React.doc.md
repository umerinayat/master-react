# React Building Custom Development Environment

## The Plan

Create Development environment from scratch using

1. Node
2. Webpack
3. Babel
4. ESLint
5. NPM Scripts

#### Here is what we are building.

- Compile JSX
- Transpile JS
- Linting ( To inforce coding standards and find potential bugs )
- Generate index.html
- Reload on save
- And do all of us in one command via npm script setup
