# React Building Custom Development Environment

## The Plan

Create Development environment from scratch using

1. Node
2. Webpack
3. Babel
4. ESLint
5. NPM Scripts

#### Here is what we are building.

- Compile JSX
- Transpile JS
- Linting ( To inforce coding standards and find potential bugs )
- Generate index.html
- Reload on save
- And do all of us in one command via npm script setup

## 1: Installing Node

To get started on our environment setup, install Node. We'ill use Node to run our development environment. Make sure you're running at least Node version 8. And if you already have Node installed or are concerned about upgrading and breaking existing projects, you have two options. You can install Node 8 or newer now to follow along and then reinstall your old version when you're done with the course, or you can run multiple versions of Node using nvm on Mac or nvmâ€‘windows on Windows.
